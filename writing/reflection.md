In this assignment I decided that the number in particular needed to be dependent on each individual input. What I mean by this is that the input number should depend on whether or not that function can run a number that large. For example, if I tried to run a number over 1500 for the TupleDouble approach then it would take a really long time for the program to complete it. However, if i ran 1000000 on the ListSingle approach it took less than 20 seconds to complete. So, in saying all of this I am justifying the use of these differing numbers for data collection because in order to collect data I needed to use numbers that were large or small enough for an output to be found based on the function command.

## Performance Analysis

Throughout this project, I learned that an intersection is much much faster with a list. In class I chose to say that a Tuple would be faster but this was False. A tuple is much slower than a list in this instance because a tuple is immutable whereas a list is mutable. This essentially means that one cannot be changes whereas the other one can. A list is mutable and this means that it can be changed, but the significance of that with respect to this project is that when given the code for a tuple, there is a section in the code that says `result += something`, this is critically important because this line of code is actually telling the tuple, that it needs to rebuild itself with that new "something" added in. Lists are different because they DO NOT require that they be completely rebuilt in order to add new data to the list. A tuple, because it is immutable, requires that all of the data within the container be changed in order for it to change the data. That is why a list is faster. This is also further exacerbated by the fact that when a tuple is given a really large number it may have hundreds, if not thousands, of numbers that would need to be added to its container so it would need to take itself apart and rebuild hundreds of times before it could produce a suitable output. A list, however, will just adjust itself based on the new data given without rebuilding.

On a different note, the for loops and sometimes nested for loops within the function can also help to determine whether or not a function will be faster. When a function uses a nested double for loop, it has to iterate over everything and see if each aspect of the list meets the condition. However, when using an if statement, the condition that the two things on the seperate data holders are the same is already set before the computer starts iterating so the computer just has to look through the list and see if anything matches as opposed to iterating through everything and then deciding on a case by case basis if they match. So to conclude, this means that the for-if statements will be faster because they set a preexisting condition before the iteration starts.

The fastest approach for computing overall is the ListSingle approach, not only is this approach able to handle things much faster, but it is also able to operate with much much larger numbers than any of the other functions. You will notice that in my data, the ListSingle approach is handling 1000000 whereas the others are only handling about 10000. Also, the data above shows that the ListSingle approach operates faster than the others even when handling a number this large. This is because this approach uses botht he for-if and List approaches that were spoken of in the above paragraphs.

## Source Code

### Describe in detail how the completed source code works

#### A class that defines the four algorithmic options for running the experiment

```
class IntersectionApproach(str, Enum):
    """Define the name for the approach for performing intersection of structured types."""

    list_single = "ListSingle"
    tuple_single = "TupleSingle"
    list_double = "ListDouble"
    tuple_double = "TupleDouble"
```

What this source code does is it defines the approach names for the different structured types. This means that it will give us the different names that we can use to specify which function we are trying to run a number with.

#### A function signature that defines the command-line interface for `intersection`

This code is the command function. Essentially, this means that this function is going to call upon other functions as they are assigned by the user to complete a task. When the function says: `if approach.value == IntersectionApproach.tuple_single` that means that the function is telling the computer to use the "tuple_single" variable which, if we go back to the class definition means that we will be using the TupleSingle approach function. This function is basically a big organizer of all of the other functions. It will take the user input and decide which function needs to be used based on that input. Just as I explained with the previous line of code, there is another corresponding line of code for each of the class definitions. This means that the function will direct the input of the user to the correct function and facilitate its running.

#### A function that can generate a data container with random values in it

```
def generate_random_container(
    size: int, maximum: int, make_tuple: bool = False
) -> Union[List[int], Tuple[int, ...]]:
    """Generate a random list defined by the size and with no number bigger than maximum."""
    # generate a list of random values
    # the size of the list must be defined by the size parameter
    # the contents of the list cannot have a number bigger than the number stored in maximum
    randomlist = []
    while len(randomlist) < size:
        n = random.randint(0, maximum)
        randomlist.append(n)
    # if the make_tuple parameter is True, then return a tuple instead of a list
    if make_tuple:
        return tuple(randomlist)
    else:
        return randomlist
```

This code helps to generate a random container for the data that will be used in the experiment. The first line is the function definition and it is used to not only define and name the function as "generate_random_container", but it also defines a couple of variables the first being: size, which is defined as an integer, maximum, which is defined as an int, and make_tuple, which is a boolean. The next lines of code are what actually generate the container as a random list. The line that says `randomlist = []` is creating an empty list called randomlist. The following code is while loop that sets the size of the list through the already determined variable called "size". The following line `n = random.randint(0, maximum)` sets a new variable called "n" and uses it to generate random integers using the .randint() command. Then it sets the range that those random integers can be made within as between zero and the already predetermined variable called "maximum". From there the code appends the randomlist and returns said list through the subsequent if statement. The if statement says that if the variable make_tuple is true then return the randomlist as a tuple if not return randomlist as an integer.
