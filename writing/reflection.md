`Run 2: TupleDouble with a large input`

```

TODO: Whenever possible, please use the same "small" and "large" inputs for both
the List-based and Tuple-based algorithms.

TODO: Do not run the program with the `--display` option when conducting
experiments!

TODO: Document and justify your choice for the `number` and `maximum` variables.

#### Two outputs from running the `ListSingle` algorithm with different inputs

#### Two outputs from running the `ListDouble` algorithm with different inputs

#### Two outputs from running the `TupleSingle` algorithm with different inputs

#### Two outputs from running the `TupleDouble` algorithm with different inputs

## Performance Analysis

TODO: Provide three paragraphs that explain which algorithm is fastest, by how
much it is faster, and how you knew that the it was faster, referencing the data
in the aforementioned command outputs to support your response. You should make
sure that you answer the following research questions:

- RQ: Is intersection faster with a list or a tuple?
- RQ: Is intersection faster with a double-for-loop or a single-for-loop?
- RQ: Overall, what is the fastest approach for computing the intersection?

TODO: Make sure that your responses explain WHY certain algorithms are faster!
TODO: It is not sufficient to only explain WHICH algorithm is faster!
